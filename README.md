# NYT Search API Group Activity

### Status
Currently the NYT query is using static search parameters. Input from a form needs to be added to the query. The NYT query results are produced at the end of the page. All the JQuery is in place. The JQuery expects one div to exist in the HTML with "id = #results" as an attribute. It will insert the NYT query results into this position.
